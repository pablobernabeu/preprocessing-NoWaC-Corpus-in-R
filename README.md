# preprocessing_NoWaC_Corpus.R

The present script can be used to preprocess data from a frequency list of the Norwegian as Web Corpus (NoWaC). 

Before using the script, the frequency list should be downloaded from  https://www.hf.uio.no/iln/english/about/organization/text-laboratory/services/nowac-frequency.html. The list is described as 'frequency list sorted primary alphabetic and secondary by frequency within each character', and the direct URL is: https://www.tekstlab.uio.no/nowac/download/nowac-1.1.lemma.frek.sort_alf_frek.txt.gz. The download requires signing in to an institutional network. Last, the downloaded file should be unzipped.
