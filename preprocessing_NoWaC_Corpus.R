# Before using this script, the frequency list should be downloaded from 
# https://www.hf.uio.no/iln/english/about/organization/text-laboratory/projects/nowac/nowac-frequency.html. 
# The list is described as 'frequency list sorted primary alphabetic and secondary by 
# frequency within each character', and the direct URL is: 
# https://www.tekstlab.uio.no/nowac/download/nowac-1.1.lemma.frek.sort_alf_frek.txt.gz. 
# The download requires signing in to an institutional network. Last, the downloaded file 
# should be unzipped.
