# 
# The frequency list was downloaded in March 2023 from 
# https://www.hf.uio.no/iln/english/about/organization/text-laboratory/services/nowac-frequency.html
# Specifically, the list was described as 'frequency list sorted primary alphabetic and 
# secondary by frequency within each character', and the direct URL was the following:    
# https://www.tekstlab.uio.no/nowac/download/nowac-1.1.lemma.frek.sort_alf_frek.txt.gz
# The download required signing in to an institutional network. Next, the downloaded file 
# was unzipped and saved.

# Many nouns are repeated in the corpus because they are tagged with more than one gender
# (for background, see Rodina & Westergaard, 2015 https://doi.org/10.1017/S1470542714000245, 
# 2021 https://doi.org/10.1017/S1470542719000217). Generally, in these ambiguous cases in
# the present corpus, either entry has a much higher frequency. To resolve these 
# ambiguities, only the entry with the highest frequency will be kept.
